  <p>##Scope:
This policy is used in concert with the LSU Libraries Collection Development Policy (CDP) and the CDP of any other contributing departments or collaborators. The digital collections included on the Louisiana Digital Library are chosen by our collaborators. This best practices document attempts to describe considerations these collaborators should make when beginning a project.</p>
<p>They are descriptive, not prescriptive, and should be thought of as guidelines. Because digital collections does not curate their own collections, we do not limit or mandate the content of collaborators’ collections beyond the fact that they must support the policies of the Libraries and that they should not unnecessarily duplicate other projects. In short, the selection of items for digital projects should be directed by the same methodologies and practices developed for collections of information in traditional formats.</p>
<p>The number one thing to keep in mind when beginning a digital project is that a <strong>well-executed digital project requires explicit planning documents, well-organized physical collections, thorough descriptions, and flexible deadlines</strong>.</p>
<p>##General questions to ask before digitization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why does your institution want to digitize these items in particular? Do you have a priority list of collections or groups of items that you are interested in digitizing?</li>
<li>Is there a particular demand for these materials? Will the items appeal to a broad audience, or just a select group? Can you define your target audience?</li>
<li>Are your items part of a larger collection of materials? How many total items do you want to digitize, whether now or later?</li>
<li>Will these items be well-suited for viewing on the web? Will the quality and detail of your digitized materials satisfy your target audience?</li>
<li>Is the condition of the items fragile or deteriorating to the point where digitizing the items might damage them further?</li>
<li>Are there any copyright restrictions that might prevent you from putting these materials online? Does your institution own the right to all of the materials? If not, what steps do you need to take to gain permission to display the items in the collection?</li>
</ul>
<p>##Format:
We are currently equipped to either digitize or outsource the digitization of the following formats. Outsourcing typically only chosen if funding is provided, materials are relatively uniform and sturdy, and a project is large enough to be impractical for our small staff.</p>
<p>###Manuscripts Documents</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Recommended size: Items less than 12.2” X 17.2” will be scanned on the Epson 11000</li>
<li>Digital access is most practical if there is a transcript or significant description that can be indexed by search engines.</li>
<li>Issues if fragile? Issues if bound?</li>
<li>Copyright concerns—accession agreement? Family approval/funding?</li>
<li>We recommend scanning manuscript documents by collection if small, or by box/series if part of a larger collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>###Print Documents</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Recommended size: 25” X 18” is the maximum for one scan; Items larger than this must be pieces together with photoshop.</li>
<li>Digital access is most practical if it can be OCRed (Optical Character Recognition); must check both language and font type for OCR capability</li>
<li>Issues to look for, especially in bound volumes, include guttering, uneven text, etc.</li>
<li>Copyright is only an issue if 1923 or later&#8211;and copyright librarian consultation may help discern whether it is an issue post 1923.</li>
<li>We recommend scanning printed items according to the unit in which they were originally printed (ie. yearbooks as volumes; sheet music as individual pieces; posters as single sheets).</li>
</ul>
<p>###Reflective Images</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Recommended size: Items less than 12.2” X 17.2” will be scanned on the Epson 11000</li>
<li>Provenance or description are particularly important for images that are scanned individually. Descriptions of sizes should be included at the photo-album or image level.</li>
<li>If bound, we will generally upload these as a multi-level compound object. If loose, we can upload folders but will default to individual items or pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>###Microfilm</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ideal film density is .7-1.3</li>
<li>Completeness of the items on the microfilm must be checked before scanning.</li>
<li>Digital access is most practical if it can be OCRed (Optical Character Recognition); must check both language and font type for OCR capability; ideally less than half of microfilmed pages should have OCR-related defects</li>
<li>We recommend including information about the provenance of the item on microfilm and when/where/by whom it was filmed.</li>
<li>Highest quality scans come from master negatives. We do not recommend using access copies or positive film for digitization.</li>
</ul>
<p>###Slides</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We can scan 35mm photographic slides on our slide scanner. We also have a transparency adapter on the Epson scanner for images up to 12.2” X 16.5” that supports 35 mm mounted slides, 35 mm film strips, medium format transparencies, and 4” x 5” film</li>
<li>Provenance or description are particularly important for images that are scanned individually. Descriptions of sizes should be included at the photo-album or image level.</li>
<li>If bound, we will generally upload these as a multi-level compound object. If loose, we can upload folders but will default to individual items or pages.</li>
</ul>
