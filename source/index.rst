This wiki is the authoritative source for information about the
Louisiana Digital Library (LDL) produced by Louisiana State University's
LSU Libraries. It will be continually updated with information about the
history of the LDL, publications about new and existing collections in
the LDL, and details about the development of the new Louisiana Digital
Library Islandora platform. LSU Digital Services has created a variety
of documentation describing procedures, policies, and past practices of
the department. This documentation is constantly evolving as the tools
available and the projects assigned grow and change. It currently
includes: 

* Information about the equipment available in our digital lab 
* How-to guides for students and GAs 
* Metadata guidelines for catalogers and other contributors 
* Forms to be filled about by those interested in beginning a new project

Our long-term goal is a website that describes the process of
digitization from idea to long-term maintenance, including adaptations
to new best practices, tools, and software platforms.

A website that provides similar information about a multi-site Islandora
infrastructure and related digital project process is `FL-Islandora
Guides <https://fig.wiki.flvc.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`__. This
site is an excellent place to look for a "wiki providing detailed user
documentation and how-tos to university & college librarians and library
staff."

Another similar site that provides an example of documentation for an
individual institution's metadata and digital services documentation is
[UA Libraries Metadata & Digital Services]
(http://www.lib.ua.edu/wiki/digcoll/index.php/Main\_Page).
