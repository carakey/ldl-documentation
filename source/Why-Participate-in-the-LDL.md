Why Participate?
================

##What is it and what does it include?
The Louisiana Digital Library (LDL) is an online library, containing photographs, maps, manuscript content, books, oral histories, and other documents and records of history and culture contributed by eligible Louisiana cultural heritage Content Providers such as libraries, archives, museums and other nonprofit organizations. 

##Why should your institution participate?
###Sustainable
The LDL is more sustainable that a personal archive or posting items to your institution’s website. It follows national and local standards that support migration between platforms, the reuse of materials in collaborative collections, and the recovery of materials if parts of the system become compromised. This prevents large files from taking up space on a an institution’s webserver and makes sure that the work put into creating your digital collections is not wasted.

###Accessible
The LDL is more accessible than any single website. By using a platform that can be exposed to search engines like Google, your items can be found through the websites your users already depend on for research. The LDL also offers a search interface of its own that allows your materials to be found by people who know they are looking for information about Louisiana, but don’t know what institution might have it.

###Standardized
Participating in the LDL requires meeting certain standards. This guarantees the quality of the items on the site. It also supports the sustainability and accessibility of the materials.

###Supported
Louisiana State University supports and develops the Louisiana Digital Library. We offer assistance, including guidance on the creation of scans or metadata. Please contact us with any questions you have about the LDL and other services we offer.

##How can we join?
Many collections in the LDL were created through a partnership with one of the existing members, but membership in the newly formed Louisiana Digital Consortium (LDC) is recommended. If you would like to become a member of the LDC, you may contact the current board chair for more information.
