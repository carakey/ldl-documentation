Zeutschel OS 12000 Advanced Scanning Procedures
===============================================

Preparing the Scanner Software Settings:
========================================

1.  Open the Omni 10 software on the desktop. (Image 1)

2.  On the Express Mode pop-up box select the project-specific preset such as “Gumbo” if you are scanning a LSU Gumbo yearbook. (Image 2) If you do not know what the appropriate preset is, ask for assistance.

3.  Use the automatic job name if possible or if a special identifier is needed you can create something memorable. (Image 3) This name will not be included on the file names but is simply used to identify a group of scans before they are moved to their finalized location.

4.  Based on the job name and other preset data it will create a temp folder. Click okay to approve this folder. (Image 4)

5.  A “metadata entry” box will appear. (Image 5) The type and sequence of these boxes will vary based on the project. Each box will have a title that displays the field name for the information (ex. “Date”) followed by a text box that displays the appropriate formatting for the metadata element (ex. YYYY_MM_DD). After filling in the field click okay and wait for the next box to appear.

   * Note: When filling in these fields, do not use any spaces or punctuation or errors may occur later in the process.

6.  Once the final metadata entry box has been filled in, colored boxes will be visible on the screen. (Image 6) These are called clips. Each clip’s settings can be adjusted, but they will be defined differently based on the project. The clips can be gathered into groups. If adjustments are necessary to clips or groups, ask for help.

   * Note: The default group settings are that “Group A” is all clips on the left and “Group B” is all clips on the right. Therefore, in order to scan only the left page press the “a” key; to scan only the right page press the “b” key; and to tell the computer to scan all clips regardless of group press “0.”

Preparing the Physical Scanning Space:
======================================

1.  Check that the white balance box is uncovered.
2.  Lay the object on the book cradle and verify that it is as straight as possible.
3.  Adjust the book cradle to the relative height of the two sides of the object to be scanned.
4.  Skip 5-8 if you are not using the glass.
5.  Lower the glass manually with the bar 45° until you feel resistance.
6.  Use the buttons to automatically lower the glass another 45° until it is flat.
7.  Select the lock button twice to unlock and relock the book cradle so that both sides of the item are perfectly flat against the glass.
8.  If the item is crooked or you need to turn a page, lift the glass automatically with the buttons 45° and then use the bar to lift it the other 45° and repeat steps 5-7.


Scanning Procedures:
====================

1.  Either click the green button on the screen or press the green button on the console. (Image 7)
2.  Pull the borders of each clip in to scan only a small amount of space around the object. (Image 8)
3.  If there is a problem with the scan then you should make necessary changes to the item and then click the olive colored button near the green button. This will rescan and the software will overwrite all of the clips of the previous scan. (Image 9)
4.  If you desire to delete scans farther back than this, you will have to right click the image of each scan on the left viewing bar and select delete. (Image 10)

Finalizing and Editing
======================

1.  Once all of the desired scans have been created select Finalize and a pop-up determined by the presets will appear. Select okay. (Image 12)
2.  Wait until the machine has finished finalizing (Image 13).
3.  Check the save location for your project to verify it saved properly.
4.  Use Adobe Photoshop on one of the other computers for any necessary editing.
5.  Use Adobe Bridge on the other computers to add metadata according to the metadata policies and procedures specific to the project.
